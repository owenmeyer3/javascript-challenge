# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Overview
This project takes UFO sighting data (including date, location and observations) and uses javascript to populate an HTML table. The table is filterable for select columns of the table.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Creates a basic HTML web page.

* Uses the UFO dataset to append a table to the web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Uses a date form in the HTML document and writes listeners for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Using multiple `input` tags, writes listeners so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

  * Otherwise, functionality is identical to Level 1
